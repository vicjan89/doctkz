msgid ""
"pandapower has a convert_format function that detects if an network that "
"was saved to the hard drive with an older version of pandapower, and "
"automatically corrects the data names and values in the element tables. "
"However, the older the network is and the more changes have been made to "
"the data structure, the more difficult it will be for the convert_format "
"function to apply all necessary changes. Therefore, it is strongly "
"advised to resave all networks when updating pandapower (especially with "
"a major update such as 2.0):"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/about/update.rst:39
msgid ""
"With pandapower 2.0, we also advice to save networks in the .json format."
" It is much more robust to updates of libraries (for example, a .p file "
"created with pandas < 0.20 can not be loaded with pandas 0.20 due to a "
"change in the internal data structures. This is not an issue when saving "
"the networks as .json files). So resave your pickle files as .json files "
