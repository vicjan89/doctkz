"Lines and transformers have two different categories of parameters: "
"parameter that depend on the specific element (like the length of a line "
"or the bus to which a transformer is connected to etc.) and parameter "
"that only depend on the type of line or transformer which is used (like "
"the rated power of a transformer or the resistance per kilometer line)."

"The standard type library provides a database of different types for "
"transformer and lines, so that you only have to chose a certain type and "
"not define all parameters individually for each line or transformer. The "
"standard types are saved in the network as a dictionary in the form of: "
"::"

"The create_line and create_transformer functions use this database when "
"you create a line or transformer with a certain standard type. You can "
"also use the standard type functions directly to create new types in the "
"database, directly load type data, change types or check if a certain "
"type exists. You can also add additional type parameters which are not "
"added to the pandas table by default (e.g. diameter of the conductor)."
