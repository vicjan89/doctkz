"CIGRE-Networks were developed by the CIGRE Task Force C6.04.02 to "
"\"facilitate the analysis and validation of new methods and techniques\" "
"that aim to \"enable the economic, robust and environmentally responsible"
" integration of DER\" (Distributed Energy Resources). CIGRE-Networks are "
"a set of comprehensive reference systems to allow the \"analysis of DER "
"integration at high voltage, medium voltage and low voltage and at the "
"desired degree of detail\"."
