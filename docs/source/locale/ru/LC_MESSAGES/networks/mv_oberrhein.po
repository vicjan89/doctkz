"Loads the Oberrhein network, a generic 20 kV network serviced by two 25 "
"MVA HV/MV transformer stations. The network supplies 141 MV/LV "
"substations and 6 MV loads through four MV feeders. The network layout is"
" meshed, but the network is operated as a radial network with 6 open "
"sectioning points."

"The network can be loaded with two different worst case scenarios for "
"load and generation, which are defined by scaling factors for loads / "
"generators as well as tap positions of the HV/MV transformers. These "
"worst case scenarios are a good starting point for working with this "
"network, but you are of course free to parametrize the network for your "
"use case."
