"According to Lindner, the household loads are 5.1 kw and the special "
"loads are 7.9 kW.     The user is suggested to assume load distribution "
"and load profile generation. The line parameters according to the given "
"types are received from pandapower standard types and literatur (as "
"stated in the code). Transformer parameters, except the given "
"'vk_percent', 'sn_mva' and voltage levels, are based the pandapower "
"standard type data."
