"There are two example networks available. The simple example network "
"shows the basic principles of how to create a pandapower network. If you "
"like to study a more advanced and thus more complex network, please take "
"a look at the more multi-voltage level example network."

"The following example contains all elements that are supported by the "
"pandapower format. It is a more realistic network than the simple example"
" and of course more complex. Using typically voltage levels for european "
"distribution networks (high, medium and low voltage) the example relates "
"characteristic topologies, utility types, line lengths and generator type"
" distribution to the various voltage levels. To set network size limits "
"the quantity of nodes in every voltage level is restricted and one medium"
" voltage open ring and only two low voltage feeder are considered. Other "
"feeders are represented by equivalent loads. As an example one double "
"busbar and one single busbar are considered."
