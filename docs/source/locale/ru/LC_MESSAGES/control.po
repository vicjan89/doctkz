"The control module allows to simulate elements that are controlled based "
"on power flows in power systems. Prominent examples are tap changer "
"controllers that adapt the tap changer of a transformer depending on a "
"measured bus voltage, or droop controllers in PV plants that adapt the "
"reactive power depending on the bus voltage."

"The control module allows you to simulate these control strategies by "
"either using a predefined controller element that comes with pandapower "
"or building your own controller in an object oriented framework. The "
"controller module is closely integrated with the timeseries module, which"
" allows you to run quasi-static timeseries simulations with controlled "
"elements."
