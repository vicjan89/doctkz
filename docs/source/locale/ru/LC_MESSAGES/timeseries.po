"The time series module is designed for the simulation of time based "
"operations and is linked to the control module. Within a time series "
"simulation controllers are used to update values of different elements in"
" each time step in a loop. Refer to :ref:`time series overview "
"<timeseriesloop>` for details and to :ref:`example <timeseriesexample>` "
"for an easy example."
