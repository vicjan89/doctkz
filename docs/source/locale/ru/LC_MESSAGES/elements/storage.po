"In order to simulate a storage system it is possible to use sgens or "
"loads to model the discharging or charging state. The power of a storage "
"can be positive or negative, so the use of either a sgen or a load is "
"(per definition of the elements) not correct. To overcome this issue, a "
"storage element can be created."

"As pandapower is not a time dependend simulation tool and there is no "
"time domain parameter in default power flow calculations, the state of "
"charge (SOC) is not updated during any power flow calculation. The "
"implementation of energy content related parameters in the storage "
"element allows to create customized, time dependend simulations by "
