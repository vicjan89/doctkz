"A power flow calculation on a pandapower network can fail to converge for"
" a vast variety of reasons, which often makes debugging difficult, "
"annoying and time consuming. To help with that, the diagnostic function "
"automatically checks pandapower networks for the most common issues "
"leading to errors. It provides logging output and diagnoses with a "
"controllable level of detail."
