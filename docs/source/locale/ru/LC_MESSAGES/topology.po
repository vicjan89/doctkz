"pandapower provides the possibility of graph searches using the networkx "
"package, which is \"a Python language software package for the creation, "
"manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and function of "
"complex networks.\" (see NetworkX documentation "

"pandapower provides a function to translate pandapower networks into "
"networkx graphs. Once the electric network is translated into an abstract"
" networkx graph, all network operations that are available in networkx "
"can be used to analyse the network. For example you can find the shortest"
" path between two nodes, find out if two areas in a network are connected"
" to each other or if there are cycles in a network.  For a complete list "
"of all NetworkX algorithms see "
"http:/networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.10/reference/algorithms.html"
